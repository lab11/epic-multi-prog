Programmer hardware for programming the epic family of devices.
Over the years many different physical connections for programming the epic chip have
been created. This programmer tries to support the common ones:

- Edge style: as used by the Irene family of sensor nodes
- Tag connect (pogo pins): new 6-pin connector from Tag Connect
- Mini prog: 6 pin 2mm connector as used by some epic devices
- Pseudo USB: micro USB connector that also uses the shield for some epic devices

All connection types have their own charging module and charging LED. The center switch
selects which header is connected to the programming lines and therefore which one should
be programmed. The board connects to a computer via a micro USB cable.
